# Intro

Some scripts that convert a series of GRE Vocabulary books in Chinese to Anki notes.

The markdown cells of the jupyter notebooks are written in Chinese, but contain
detailed explanation and walk through.

`explore_all_in_one.ipynb` converts the txt source file to a structured dict object.

`anki_import.ipynb` uses the converted dict object to generate import file for Anki.

`readmdict.py` `ripemd128.py` `pureSalsa20.py` are the tools to unzip mdd and mdx file.
See https://bitbucket.org/xwang/mdict-analysis/overview for more details.

I share the ready to use import txt and audio files on baiduyun. You can use the
example_usage.apkg to build the note type.
