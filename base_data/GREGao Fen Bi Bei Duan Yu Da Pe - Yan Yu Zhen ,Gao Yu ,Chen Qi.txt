给时光以生命，而不是给生命以时光。





# 序一

2001年的春天，我和班里唯一的上海同学俞中去听托福课程。我们是当时班里仅有的两个准备托福的人。上课的每个周末都阳光明媚，那时不会骑自行车的我，每次都是坐在俞中的自行车后座，让他带我从北航去教室。课上我负责听课，俞中负责趴着睡觉。但是他是睡不好的，因为教课的那几位老师真的太牛了，他们的谈笑风生总会把睡梦中的俞中拉回托福的题目中，然后俞中会问我讲到哪里了。现在回想起来，每周最开心的时光，莫过于周末那两天听孙继军、张晓楠和王令老师的托福课程，那时中午的盒饭甚至都因这三位老师的魅力而变得味道不同。

在那个偶尔点缀着沙尘暴的明媚的春天，大二轻松愉悦的备考托福的过程中却夹杂着GRE给我带来的极大的痛苦。一个人这辈子能记得多少刻骨铭心的文字，更何况是一段非母语的文字。那个春天，我被下面这段文字彻底打败，每次看到它都有窒息、抓耳挠腮的纠结感。甚至有为它高唱“就这样被你征服”的冲动。

A desire to throw over reality a light that never was might give way abruptly to the desire on the part of what we might consider a novelist-scientist to record exactly and concretely the structure and texture of a flower.

这段文字让我牢牢地记住了一个人的名字——Thomas Hardy，这个名字要比GRE考试中出现次数更多的Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf和Edgar Allen Poe来得更加刻骨铭心。正在上着托福课，而且GRE单词连E字母都没有背完的我，面对这段英文必然是各种哽咽。绝望的是，即使单词都查出来还是看不懂。看不懂怎么办，就只好心一横把它背下来了。这仿佛有一种你不从我，我就硬上的意味。但后来，这种不明白就记住的方式对我一直受用，这其实与当年的老领导说的“理解要执行，不理解也要执行。不理解，边执行边理解”有异曲同工之处。

如今回头看这段文字，当然知道这里的几处搭配是不能分离成孤立的单词来理解的。而那时的GRE备考资料，最火爆的自然是GRE单词书。而对于句中搭配的重要性，恐怕是因为相对于那浩瀚的GRE单词微不足道，根本就无人关注。

2011年8月开始的新GRE，去除了之前单纯考查单词的类比、反义题目，加大了对于阅读的考查。而在美国读书的阶段，写作与阅读必然是学术生活中最需要提升的能力。而这些搭配往往就是决定一句、一段的逻辑走向的方向标志。同时，通过12000多个小时的一线GRE教学接触到的十几万GRE学生，让我知道当年读不懂的我，其实并不孤独。

因此，我们为你送上这样一本短语搭配书，让你知道bear out不是“熊出来了”，bring something to bear on不是“给熊带某物”，have little bearing on更不是“一只小熊在上面”。至于看到forbear和overbearing后，也不要再胡思乱想了，肯定不能翻译成“为了小熊”和“在上面的小熊”，这些单词在“再要你命3000”里会有它们清楚的解读。

同时，这本书，对于我来说，也是一个新的开始。这是我在离开工作了十年的老东家之后的第一本书。而对于你来说，它是GRE备考历史上，第一本有关GRE考试短语搭配的书。我们为它选择了我们这套GRE备考“彩虹书”系列中的红色作为封面颜色，希望它能成为新GRE备考历史上的新“红宝书”。

可是，因为这本短语书，你将不再感受到我们面对那些搭配时的痛苦。这是一件好事，还是一种遗憾呢？

感谢2013年冬，那个寒冷的夜晚，在Maan Coffee进门的风口处认识了高宇——一个专注于GRE阅读的小伙子。这本书的雏形就在那个大风吹的风口处吹出了灵感。

感谢2010年冬，北大理教门口羞涩的颜余真全程陪同在北大二教的讲座，那一晚组织的讲座让我们点燃了北大700多名同学的热情。从此我们之间有了这么多的信任。“再要你命3000”的编写过程中，你是最优秀的编者。即使你远在13个时区之外的普林斯顿，这本短语书的编写团队也绝对少不了你。

感谢一直支持我们的学生，创业以来，你们不离不弃！

请让我们为你的GRE备考之路加油助力！

一生悬命。

# 序二

新泽西的夏夜，普林斯顿的大街上空无一人，校园的实验室里灯火通明。

实验室里的仪器忙碌地运行着，一个样品需要分析半个小时。趁着空闲的时间，我坐在一旁，看着电脑上一个又一个的英文词组，忙碌地查找它们的释义和例句。

这就是过去一个多月我的典型生活状态，大家现在看到的这本书，就是这一个多月我和琦叔还有其他编者共同努力的成果。但这并不是我和琦叔的第一次合作：把时钟拨回到2011年，那时我有幸参与了“再要你命3000”的编写；回到2010年底，考了两次GRE（感谢ETS的乌龙），误打误撞加入了琦叔的“小牛人俱乐部”；而初识琦叔更得追溯到2010年秋天琦叔在北大二教的一场讲座——我是彼时组织方的成员。

时光荏苒，很快我的本科生涯告一段落，我如愿来到美国深造。来到普林斯顿之后，一方面有课业负担，另一方面要进行科研，所以当琦叔再次联系我参加新书编写时，我多少是有些犹豫的。但回想起“3000”出版后的欣喜与自豪（事实上这是我觉得在本科阶段最为骄傲的成就之一），我咬咬牙，答应了琦叔，加入到了这本短语搭配书的编写当中。

说到就要做到。很简单的一句话，但就是这句话支撑我在过去的一个多月里为新书的出版而奋斗。不难料想，编写一本市面上没有先例的GRE短语书籍充满了挑战，从选短语到中英解释，再到真题例句，最后到课后练习，每一个环节无不需要精心设计，仔细推敲。为此，我们细读了237篇GRE阅读文章和763道GRE填空题，从中精心挑选了英语阅读和写作当中常用的365个词组。为了便于大家理解和记忆，我们选取了*Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary*当中通俗易懂的自带语境解释。真题例句的翻译我们也是每个字都反复斟酌，一个句子在编者们的邮件中反复讨论五六次并不稀罕，只为解释精准而不晦涩。课后练习的例句更是摘自*Nature, Science, The Economist*等顶级期刊，阅读这些句子本身即是一种知识的扩充。为了让大家理解怎样把词组使用到GRE当中去，我们的练习还配备了中文句子翻译，这些句子都可以用在Issue和Argument的写作中。所有这些都是为了让这本书更加贴近考试，并且让大家有一个愉快的备考体验。

回头看来，和琦叔合作的这些经历还有“3000”的热卖让我意识到：把一件事情努力做到最好带来的不仅仅是眼前的回报，更重要的是这种努力展现了一种能让人信赖的品质。这种品质让人在未来的某刻也会想到你，从而又有了展示自我的机会，带来一种良性循环。我现在想想，为什么身边有的人在人生路上一帆风顺，上好的学校，找好的工作，这是因为他们把握住了每一个机会，努力让自己发光，让别人看见并欣赏。所以，与其说成功靠的是命运和运气，不如说是靠一步一步踏踏实实走出来的。

停止空谈，开始行动。如果你想证明自己有把一件事做到完美的能力，我想GRE考试会是一个不错的选择。既然这本书已经在你的手中，那就从现在开始吧。

# 使用说明

笔者基于历年GRE考试的阅读文章和填空题，精选了GRE考试中最常见的365个短语搭配，给出每个搭配的中英文释义，并配有简单例句和GRE试题例句。为巩固记忆，在每个单元后还配备了练习，包括短语填空、释义匹配和写作句子翻译。

#### 本书有如下特色：

**理念超前：**本书是市面上第一本针对GRE考试短语搭配的书籍。过去考生只能记单个单词，而对单词之间的搭配缺乏了解，因此无法解题。本书的出现解决了这一问题，弥补了当今GRE备考资料当中的一块空白。

**释义明了：**所有短语搭配的释义均参考*Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary*，结合语境进行解释。朴实生动的英文解释帮助考生理解记忆，并形象生动地展示了写作中如何使用这些短语搭配。此外，每条英文解释中均以加粗和下画线标记出单词考点所在，这一特征与《GRE核心词汇考法精析》的单词标记风格一致，便于考生迅速把握短语的特征，在平时背诵的过程逐步由中式思维转换为英式思维。

**结合实战：**每个短语搭配均配备了GRE阅读或填空试题例句，可以进一步强化记忆，帮助理解。每单元后的检测练习也基本采用GRE填空试题，从而帮助考生复习GRE考试中常考的其他词汇，一举多得。

**写作训练：**本书是第一本在课后练习中囊括GRE写作常见句子翻译的GRE备考书籍，这些句子都是Argument中的常见句式以及部分Issue题的论证句子，建议各位考生认真对待，并在有需要的情况下适当背诵。

#### 本书用法：

对于本书内包含的365个短语搭配的使用方法，建议分成以下三个阶段：

**第一阶段：**考生在大量练习阅读和填空题目之前应该先熟悉这365个短语搭配。第一阶段做到熟悉即可，可以只看每个短语搭配中所包含的中文释义、英文释义和简单例句，GRE原句可以先保留不看。这样既不会影响第一次做GRE填空和阅读题目的真实程度，也能够做到理解短语搭配的大意。

**第二阶段：**在考生完成《GRE基础填空24套精练与精析》和《GRE阅读精练200篇》的第一遍练习之后，阅读复杂逻辑句子的能力有了一定的提升。在此基础之上，第二阶段需要认真分析短语搭配词条中的GRE例句（选自填空和阅读原句），深刻理解短语搭配在原句语境中的意思，并对一些表示逻辑关系的短语搭配加深记忆，比如bear out, account for等以及句中的同义与反义重复。部分原句本身就属于极有价值的长难句，这些句子甚至可以背下来。在这个阶段，要格外关注每个短语搭配释义中加粗和下画线部分的内容，这个部分是对该短语核心考法的提炼。同时，每完成一个单元的短语学习，请配套完成相应检测练习中的短语填空和释义匹配两道题目。

**第三阶段：**真正掌握一个单词或短语搭配意义的表现是能够准确地将它们运用到写作中。所以在这个阶段，请各位考生完成检测练习中的写作句子翻译题目，真正掌握短语搭配的用法，做到在阅读和填空中能明白其意思，在写作中能够将其运用自如，并借助地道的搭配整体提升复杂学术文章的阅读与写作能力。

愿这本书能帮助各位考生取得理想成绩！





# Unit 1

**stop short of　决定不做……**

**释** If you **stop short of** doing something, you decide **not to do** something.

**例** In spite of the escalating turmoil in Ukraine, EU leaders stopped well short of an immediate strengthening of sanctions against Moscow.

**题** While the delegate clearly sought to dampen the optimism that has emerged recently, she stopped short of suggesting that the conference was near collapse and might produce nothing of significance.

尽管这位代表明显在努力打压最近出现的乐观情绪，但她并不去暗示会议濒临崩溃，并且这个会议很可能不会产生任何意义。

**jockey for　不择手段地争取**

**释** If you say that someone is **jockeying for** something, you mean that they are **using whatever methods** they can in order **to get** it or do it before their competitors can get it or do it.

**例** Operators are jockeying for lucrative 3G position with new cell phone subscribers far outpacing new fixed-line phone users.

**题** Although Johnson’s and Smith’s initial fascination with the fortunes of those jockeying for power in the law firm flagged after a few months, the two paid sufficient attention to determine who their lunch partners should be.

尽管Johnson和Smith一开始对律师事务所中那些不择手段争权夺利的人的命运表现出的痴迷在几个月后衰退了，但是他们仍然对与谁共进午餐给予足够关注。

**per se　本身；本质上**

**释** **Per se** means“by itself”or“in itself,”and is used when you are talking about the qualities of one thing considered **on its own**, rather than in connection with other things.

**例** Alcohol is not lethal per se; it is only when taken in excess that it becomes dangerous.

**题** Monkey groups therefore see to be organized primarily to maintain their established social order rather than to engage in hostilities per se.

就猴子群体本身而言，组织是为了维持既有的社会结构而不是为了采取敌对行为。

**silver lining　困境中的一线希望；积极的一面**

**释** If you talk about **a silver lining**, you are talking about **something positive** that comes out of a sad or unpleasant situation.

**例** The fall in inflation and the rise of consumption index are the silver lining of a prolonged economic recession.

**题** Historian George Coulton attributed a silver lining to the Black Death: prosperity engendered by diminished competition for food, shelter, and work led survivors of the epidemic into the Renaissance and subsequent rise of modern Europe.

历史学家George Coulton看到了黑死病中积极的一面：对食物以及住处和工作的竞争减少带来了某种意义上的繁荣，这使瘟疫的幸存者们得以进行文艺复兴运动，并最终带来了现代欧洲的崛起。

**in the grip of　受……的巨大影响**

**释** If a person, group, or place is **in the grip of** something, they are being **severely affected** by it.

**例** Australia is a dry continent and is in the grip of the worst drought in a century.

**题** Our“frailties”— emotions and motives such as rage, fear, greed, gluttony, joy, lust, love — may be a very mixed assortment, but they share at least one immediate quality: we are, as we say,“in the grip”of them.

我们性格上的弱点——诸如愤怒、恐惧、贪婪、饕餮、享乐、淫欲、爱情这些情绪——可能拥有着混杂的特质，但至少有一点相似的是：就像我们说的那样，我们受到了它们巨大的影响。

**bear out　证实**

**释** If something **bears out** an assumption or a theory, it **provides evidence** to that assumption or theory.

**例** Further data analysis would eventually bear out that the universe’s rate of expansion was decreasing.

**题** The effects of the mechanization of women’s work have not borne out the frequently held assumption that new technology is inherently revolutionary.

女性工作机械化的影响尚不能证实人们经常持有的一种假设，即新科技在本质上都是革命性的。

**status quo　原状；现状**

**释** The **status quo** is the state of affairs that **exists at a particular time**, especially in contrast to a different possible state of affairs.

**例** Fundamentalists in this Muslim nation swear to do everything necessary to maintain the status quo, even if that will bring bloodshed.

**题** This“self-sterilizing”capacity of the skin results from the tendency of all well-developed ecosystems toward homeostasis, or the maintenance of the status quo.

皮肤的“自我净化”能力源于所有成熟的生态系统达成动态平衡的倾向，或者说这种净化能力源于对现状的维持。

**hinge on　取决于**

**释** Something that **hinges on** one thing or event **depends entirely on** it.

**例** The success of our plan hinges on secrecy.

**题** According to this model, specialist foundings hinge on the interplay between legitimation and competitive forces, both of which are functions of the density \(total number\) of firms in a particular specialist population.

这个模型认为专业类公司（注：服务一类特定的很小市场的公司）的建立取决于合理性和竞争强度，这两者都随着特定领域中专业公司的密度（总数）而变化。

**be pitted against　与……抗争**

**释** If two opposing things or people **are pitted against** one another, they are **in conflict**.

**例** This film festival gave young directors a chance to pit themselves against professionals of many years’ experience.

**题** In addition, the style of some Black novels, like Jean Toomer’s *Cane*, verges on expressionism or surrealism; does this technique provide a counterpoint to the prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black heroes are pitted, a theme usually conveyed by more naturalistic modes of expression?

此外，这类黑人小说的风格——例如Jean Toomer的《公民凯恩》——几乎就是表现主义或超现实主义的风格；这种技巧是否为表现黑人英雄与命运抗争这一盛行的主题提供了一种对立的思路？而以往这种主题通常由自然的表达方式进行叙述。

**be punctuated by　被……打断**

**释** If an activity or situation **is punctuated by** particular things, it **is interrupted by** them **at intervals**.

**例** The semi-final was punctuated by a series of malicious fouls.

**题** The epoch that geologists know as the Pleistocene and that spanned the 1.5 to 2.0 million years prior to the current geologic epoch was not one long continuous glaciation, but a period of oscillating climate with ice advances punctuated by times of interglacial climate not very different from the climate experienced now.

这个时代被地质学家称为更新世，是我们现在所处地质时代之前大约持续了150至200万年的时代，但它并不是一个连续的冰河时期，这个时代气候是不断变化的，伴随着冰川的前进以及穿插其中的、与现代气候相似的间冰期。

# Unit 2

**put another way　换句话说**

**释** To **put it another way** means to **rephrase or reinstate** what has just been said.

**例** Regulation and creation can coexist, or put it another way, it is possible to both follow a rule and make a breakthrough.

**题** Put another way, it may be that on average 99 percent of all deaths in a population arise from density-independent causes, and only one percent from factors varying with density.

换句话说，可能人口中百分之九十九的死亡产生于与密度无关的原因，只有百分之一的死因是与人口密度变化的因素相关的。

**to some extent　一定程度上**

**释** You use expressions such as to a large extent, **to some extent**, or to a certain extent in order to indicate that something is **partly true**, but **not entirely true**.

**例** I can only help you understand this concept to some extent; you really need to do the experiment yourself to get a clear idea about what is going on.

**题** To test the efficacy of borrowing from one field of study to enrich another, simply investigate the extent to which terms from the one may, without forcing, be utilized by the other.

要测试一门学科受益于另一门学科的程度，只需简单地去调查这个领域中的术语在没有被强迫的情况下在另一个领域中得到了多大程度上的运用。

**for one thing　首先**

**释** You use **for one thing** to indicate the **first fact or reason** that people should pay attention to.

**例** For one thing, the Olympic Games provided Asia a huge amount of economic chance.

**题** For one thing, no population can be driven entirely by density-independent factors all the time.

首先，没有任何群体会始终被完全与密度无关的因素所驱赶。

**run for　参加竞选**

**释** If someone **runs for** office in an election, they take part as a **candidate**.

**例** The scandal of the candidate is seen by many as retribution for his anti-corruption campaign, not as a way to stop him running for election.

**题** Given her previously expressed interest and the ambitious tone of her recent speeches, the senator’s attempt to convince the public that she is not interested in running for a second term is futile.

考虑到该议员此前早已表示过参选的兴趣以及近来演讲中雄心勃勃的口气，她几乎不可能让大家相信她对参加连任竞选没有兴趣。

**turn out　被发现是**

**释** If something **turns out** to be a particular thing, it **is discovered** to be that thing.

**例** Much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

**题** The idea of an autonomous discipline called“philosophy,”distinct from and sitting in judgment on such pursuits as theology and science turns out, on close examination, to be of quite recent origin.

“哲学”是一种完全独立存在、明显有别于神学和科学并能对后两者进行评价的学科，但仔细研究却表明“哲学”本身是一个出现得很晚的概念。

**depart from　违反；另辟蹊径**

**释** If you **depart from** a traditional, accepted, or agreed way of doing something, you do it **in a different or unexpected way**.

**例** At this point in the speech, the minister eventually decided to depart from his prepared text to appease the angry audience.

**题** While scientists dismiss as fanciful the idea of sudden changes in a genetic code \(spontaneous mutation\), it is possible that nature, like some master musicians, improvises on occasion, departing from the expected or predictable.

尽管科学家认为基因组的快速变化（自发变异）是天方夜谭，但大自然很可能像那些杰出的音乐大师一样即兴演奏，违反既有的可预测规律。

**far from　远远不是**

**释** If you say that something is **far from** a particular thing or far from being the case, you are **emphasizing** that it is not that particular thing or **not at all** the case, especially when people expect or assume that it is.

**例** Quite contrary to the public perception, the debate on forecasting climate change and its impact within scientific community is far from over.

**题** Hampshire’s assertions, far from showing that we can dismiss the ancient puzzles about objectivity, reveal the issue to be even more relevant than we had thought.

Hampshire的论断让我们意识到有关客观性的古代谜题的话题比想象中更具相关性，我们远不能忽略有关话题。

**set apart　区别开**

**释** If something **sets** someone or something **apart**, it **makes** them **different from** other people or things.

**例** Supreme ability of languages set humans apart from the rest of the animal kingdom.

**题** At the same time that Gilpin’s interest in landscape work distinguished her from most other women photographers, her approach to landscape photography set her apart from men photographers who, like Gilpin, documented the western United States.

Gilpin对于景观作品的兴趣与其他绝大部分女摄影师不同，与此同时她在景观摄影中使用的方法也与像她那样记录美国西部的其他男性摄影师区别了开来。

**come into being　形成**

**释** Something that is in being or **comes into being** **exists**.

**例** Objectively speaking, the society of today is greatly different from that of 30 years ago, and different social classes and benefit groups come into being.

**题** The methods that a community devises to perpetuate itself come into being to preserve aspects of the cultural legacy that that community perceives as essential.

一个社区为了延续自身存在而设计的方法，最终形成了一种能够保存该社区认为是关键精髓的文化遗产的方法。

**in spite of　尽管**

**释** You use **in spite of** to introduce a fact which **makes** the rest of the statement you are making **seem surprising**.

**例** Josef at the State Opera hired her in spite of the fact that she had never sung on stage.

**题** In spite of the fact that it is convenient to divide the life span of animals into separate stages such as prenatal, adolescent, and senescent, these periods are not really distinct.

尽管把动物的生命分割为独立的阶段——例如产前期、青春期和老年期——是非常方便的，但这些阶段并非完全独立。
